In this project, we build and use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the next-day stock return direction based on OHLCV data visualized as images (based on [Stock price forecasting model based on modified convolution neural network and financial time series analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/dac.3987) from J Cao and J Wang). With an out-of-sample accuracy of 55.4%, the model supports investment strategies that outperform traditional methods.
